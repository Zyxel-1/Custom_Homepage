## Known Bugs

These are the known bugs I have encountered:

1. When loading a specific page via the url it might throw an error. This is probably because how Netlify sets up the project. So as of right now you can't rsanchez92.com/asdf or /projects you have to go from the homepage to projects.
2. When scrolling down on the home page and you click on projects it won't start you from the top but way down on the screen.
3. MOBILE IS BROKEN AGAIN (as of Nov . 12)
