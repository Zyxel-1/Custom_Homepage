      <h2>Context</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">What is Whatfits?</span>
      <p>Whatfits is a web application to create a community of gym goers where we focus on encouragement to
        improve one's health through social exercise as part of our senior design project. Our main goal is to
        use motivation and community to help people adopt healthy habits by having users find others with similar
        skill levels and based on location. We designed this project during our fall 2017 semester which included
        the requirements need to achieve this, design documentaion, technology specification document,
        project plan, design document, and test plan document. The following semester was used to implement these
        designs
        to meet the deadline of May 2018 as an agile team. Whatfits was a collaborative effort between Aaron Pham,
        Abram Villanueva, George Cheng, Longcheng Chi, and Roberto Sanchez.

      <h2>Using Power of the Internet</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">Trying to create a community for all</span>
      <p>The main objective for the class is to create a unique web application where we as students can design and
        build a
        solution to a problem that exists in the world. For us we decided to create a community for people to find
        others to
        workout since people are social creatures and creating a tool to help them socialize will create a positive
        feedback
        loop that encourages people to be physically active. Project idea was originally created by Aaron Pham and
        later expanded
        by the team as we thought of ways to add additional value to the solution.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Current online applications focus more on people with experience working out or just cataloging workouts such
        as Strava or MyFitnessPal.
        Living in a modern world people can survive moving very little (especially if you can order food from your
        phone and delivered to your house) it
        has become a challenge to get people moving. Modern conviences gave us a very sedentary life style, add in
        easily obtainable high caloric foods and
        you have a health crisis on your hand.

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">Trying to solve what many have failed</span>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/Idea.png">
      <p>We wanted to create a web application based around social media and finding either other people to workout in
        your area or to find
        activities that require physical excersize such as hiking or rock climbing. This is what we came up with:</p>
      <h3>Find people in your area</h3>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/search.png">
      <p>Current scope reduces the test market to Los Angeles and Orange Counties. If you registered an address within
        this area you
        can find other people within the same area. You can filter based on how close they are or by skill level
        (Beginner, Intermidiate, or Advance)
      </p>
      <h3>Chat and Personality</h3>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/feature.png">
      <p>We create tools to customize your profile with information about you to let others know what your goals are
        and give
        a better idea who you are as a person. We also gave you the ability to communicate with possible matches to
        schedule activities.
      </p>
      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/activities.png">
      <p>When meeting new people you can schedule a wide varaity of activies. Its catered to what you are willling to
        do.</p>
      <h3>Track your growth and others</h3>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/rate.png">
      <p>Provided is tools to track your workouts and see how you grown when you started. It also allows others to see
        your workout style. In addition
        you can rate the people you where around based on your personal experience with them.
      </p>
      <h3>Make lifelong friends</h3>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/follow.png">
      <p>You can follow the people you enjoyed and can continue to communicate with them easily.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Reality</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">What is project planning and resource management?</span>
      <p>During the design phase we where encourage to add features to make our application more unique however we
        failed to
        grasp what was possible with 3-4 months of development especally if its our first attempt at a web application
        with that
        many features. We had to negotiate with our instructor to trim back our backlog to a more managable backlog
        capable of being
        completed by the May deadline. In addition we where losing two people from our team of 7, so we had to make
        some cuts.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a short list of cool features that we had to either scale back or straight out cut.
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Paid Coaches (CUT) - A method of getting trainers to sell their services on our platform for a revenue
            stream.</li>
          <li>Logging and Archiving (CUT) - Due to the current scope of the project we won't be needed this until a
            certain freshold is achieved.</li>
          <li>Usage Analysis Dashboard (CUT) - Current scope has aproximately 150 - 200 users so this is not a
            priority.</li>
          <li>Biometrics (CUT) - No integration with Fitbit or other health devices.</li>
          <li>Team Builder (CUT) - Our attempt to create sports teams based on people in your area.</li>
          <li>Calorie Tracker (CUT) - A way to input what you ate and track the calories.</li>
          <li>Workout Logger (TRIMMED) - We only focused on a handful of workouts such as cardio (biking and running)
            and weightlifting.</li>
          <li>Event Manager (CUT) - A system to create events and to find events such as marathons or sport events to
            participate in.</li>
          <li>Ratings / ReviewS (TRIMMED) - Users review other people they met up with.</li>
        </ul>

      </figure>
      <p>So after all that we still had quite alot to develop but we were confident we could accomplish this by the
        deadline.
        <br>
        Here is what is going to be built:
        <ul>
          <li>Registration</li>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">When project planning is critical</span>
      <h3>Set up</h3>
      <p>Development technically started around the beginning of Januaray after winter break was ending however we
        already
        set up the server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a sample html website with a SSL certificate to learn
        the ins and outs
        of hosting on a Windows Server and using Internet Information System (IIS). We also created the Github
        repository ready
        for hosting our project. </p>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>We began setting up both the Vue.js project and WebAPI project on our Github and began developing key
        components of
        our application such as the database and registration of users. For our first sprint we set ourselves in
        features that
        did not depend on any others since we needed all team members working on something and not waiting for others
        to finish their
        part. Despite our efforts sprint 1 was rough.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Moving on</h3>
      <p>Sprint 2 went much easier and we where able to meet the deadline for this sprint since by then we manage to
        get key components working together. Unfortunatly we
        lost a team member and had to scale back some items such as the Single Sign On functionality.
      </p>
      <p>Sprint 3 was a rush to get everything working together. We ran into issues such as configuring routes so our
        front-end and back-ends communicate effectively on the server.</p>

      <h2>Final MVP</h2>
      <span class="subTitle">Months of work concluded</span>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/ProjectImages/Whatfits/Whatfits.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 9 - A screenshot of the finished homescreen. I wanted to use a video for the hero menu but ran
          out of time.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After 4 months in development Whatfits was officially deployed during our live deployment presentation on our
        last
        day of school. During that presentation we where to show how we deployed it, deployed the database, and set up
        IIS to host
        our web app. After that we where to give a demonstration of each of our features.
      </p>
      <h3>Registration</h3>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oTfOzRJ.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 10 - A section of the registration page. Focusing on the strong password enforcer while using
          "password" as the password. I configured it to Troy Hunt's recommended sepecifications.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Built and designed by Abram Villanueva, for registration we need the following data inorder to get a user to start using
        our application.
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Username - Authentication Reasons</li>
          <li>Password - Authentication Reasons</li>
          <li>Full Name - User Profile</li>
          <li>Address - For Searching</li>
          <li>Skill Level - User Profile and Searching</li>
          <li>3 Security Questions and Answers - Password Recovery</li>
        </ul>

        Username is suppose to be unique and is a way for finding other users. Password is utilizing <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">Troy
          Hunt's database</a><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> to verify if your password is
        vulnerable.Typing in a weak or generic password will display a warning message and prevent user from
        registering. We believe this is a better approach than generating an arbitrary password with bewildering
        requirements (i.e. Those passwords that want at least 2 capitalized letters ,1 number, and 1 special
        character.)
        The address is being checked against <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start">
          Google's Geocode API</a><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> to validate if the address is located
        within the specified area we are targeting.

      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 11 - Screenshot of the password recovery section of registration.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once a user inputs a valid username and password along with the other required information for registering you
        get the following modal once you're fully registered in our system.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/daWidTj.gif">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 12 - Welcome to Whatfits! Login and start using our platform. I used the gif on that modal to
          make it more interesting.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>After registering you can go to the home page and click/tap on the login button located at the top right and
        sign in with your credentials.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/txQJMni.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 13 - The login modal built and designed by Aaron Pham. Simple and clean.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once the system authenticates you, you'll be redirected to the default profile page. Here you can start
        customizing your profile to give it a more personal touch. You can also start using any of the other features
        provided on the profile. </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OvoHzOa.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 14 - Default profile page. I designed the profile section on the left. Everyone else's feature
          was placed on the profile to be used. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Password Recovery</h3>
      <p>Built and designed by Aaron Pham, the password recovery tool uses a link on the login modal to recovery your
        password. Taking in a username it will bring out the three security questions to be answered by the user. Only
        if the three questions are successfully answered you can reset your password and try to login again. </p>

      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 16 - Answer all three and you'll be presented with an input field for a new password.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Edit Profile</h3>
      <p>Built and designed by me, the edit profile console exists to customize your profile to your liking. Users can change their profile image, change name, change skill level, change gender, and add a little description. One thing that we were planning on scrapping was the email section.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CidlkFT.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 17 - Edit profile console. Once you changed the information you go back to your profile to see the changes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is an example of what is capable on the profile page. Once the page loads it will bring in data from the server and render it on the screen.</p>

        <figcaption>Fig. 18 - A sample profile screen.</figcaption>

      <h3>Workout Logs</h3>
      <p>Built and designed by George Cheng, Logs workouts based on whether its cardio or weightlifting and displays them on the user's profile</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5FskO1y.png">
      <figure class="center">

      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 20 - A close up of the workout logger.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A user can have as many workout logs as they desire. We wanted to include more activites but that was out of our current scope at the time.
      </p>
      <h3>Chat</h3>
      <p>Designed and built by Longcheng Chi, this feature enables users to communicate with each other within our application. Utilizing web sockets we can communincate in real time within our friend's list.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LC2RaXB.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 21 - A chat between two users.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>Built and designed by George Cheng, users can leave reviews of other users on their profile page for other users to see.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/17vTcIg.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 22 - One review left by a person. Unfortunatly we left out the name of the reviewer.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Search</h3>
      <p>Designed and built by Abram Villanueva, this allows you to be social with other registered users. You input an address that you want to find users. Once found they appear on the search results with how far they are in miles. You can filter based on address, skill, and distance.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wfrnfEP.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 23 - Searching based on an address located in Los Angeles county.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>User Management</h3>
      <p>Designed and built by me, the user management console is used exclusivly by an administrator to manage users. For creating new users we reuse the fields for registration however now sporting a new dropdown to set up whether its a general user or another admin.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIl9Ucm.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 24 - Creating a new user.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Here an admin can enable and disable users based on certain criteria such as if the user in question is misbehaving or has been blocked by failed registrations (Not implemented in current scope).</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mHiU7g6.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 26 - Enabling and disabling users.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>An admin can also delete users especally for deleting dummy accounts used for testing.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rWzoi3H.png">
      <figure class="center">
        <figcaption>Fig. 27 - Delete users. Only used for testing purposes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>That concludes all the features for this web application.</p>
